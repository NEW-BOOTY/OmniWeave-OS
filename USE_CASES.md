OmniWeave OS — Enterprise, Defense, and AI Use Cases

OmniWeave OS is a supervised execution and governance fabric designed
to control, observe, and enforce policy across multi-runtime systems.
It provides cryptographic integrity, deterministic supervision, and
audit-grade telemetry.

------------------------------------------------------------
Enterprise Use Cases
------------------------------------------------------------

1) Governed Build-to-Run Orchestration
- Deterministic runtime bring-up across polyglot stacks
- Cryptographically signed build and configuration manifests
- Policy-gated startup (license + integrity + configuration checks)

2) Compliance & Audit Logging
- JSONL provenance chains for investigations and compliance
- Repeatable lifecycle timelines (start, stop, restart, failure)
- Exportable telemetry for SIEM platforms (Splunk, ELK, Chronicle)

3) Controlled Plugin Ecosystem
- Declarative plugin manifests
- Sandboxed execution (macOS sandbox-exec, Linux bubblewrap)
- Least-privilege resource enforcement

------------------------------------------------------------
Defense / Forensics Use Cases
------------------------------------------------------------

1) Forensic-Ready Execution Fabric
- Immutable event trails for custody reconstruction
- Signed artifacts for integrity verification
- Predictive indicators for anomalous behavior

2) Mission System Supervisory Plane
- Multi-runtime supervision with restart policies
- Integrity verification before activation
- Offline-capable operation (no cloud dependency)

3) Controlled Toolchain Deployment
- Deterministic packaging and verification
- Restricted-network compatibility
- Separation of supervisor, runtime, and plugin responsibilities

------------------------------------------------------------
AI Platform Use Cases
------------------------------------------------------------

1) Predictive Operations
- Continuous signal analysis from runtime heartbeats
- Early warning indicators for instability and drift

2) Agent and Plugin Execution
- Sandboxed AI agents and tools
- Signed policies and artifacts
- Provenance tracking for AI behavior

3) Regulated AI Governance
- Policy gates before execution
- Verifiable integrity chain
- Supervisor-enforced stop conditions
